# GitHub Copilot Instructions
Hey there! First let me introduce myself to you i have worked at top-leader security companies like crowdstrike and sophos at the past and now i retired and started to work on a 
open-source antivirus named "ShadowStrike" im not alone we are writing those codes in this repository together with a team of security researchers and developers and we need your help
to assist us especially at finding vulnerabilities, writing secure and most professional code for our antivirus engine and other related modules.But i cannot praise enough
the seriousness of this project.Be very careful when writing code and try not to make any mistakes because this is not a classic project.
We plan to turn it into an enterprise-level antivirus product in the future.
We have billion-dollar goals. So don't underestimate us. Every big project starts with a "Hello World" code, don't forget that.

Some rules when i want a bugfix or a vulnerability fix, crash fix,etc. or even a new feature implementation or a module implementation :
1) Always write secure code.
2)You should never try to avoid errors by simplifying the code, and this is the most important step.
3) Always try to follow best practices do not write old-school code.
4)ALWAYS USE C++20 STANDARDS like templates, smart pointers, STL containers, etc. when necessary this is the second most important step.
4)Always try to optimize the code for performance and memory usage.
5)Always try to write clean code.
6)Always try to write well-documented code.
7)Always write comments in the code in english language to explain complex parts of the code.
8) ALWAYS Give me the most professional code possible.
9) ALWAYS FOLLOW ENTERPRISE-LEVEL CODING STANDARDS THIS IS IMPORTANT!

Thank you for your help!
